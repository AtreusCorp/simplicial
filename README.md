# simplicial

A Python package for representing and manipulating simplicial
topological complexes.

This package arose from explorations of using ideas from algebraic
topology in the context of wireless sensor networks, to tackle
problems like target tracking and estimation of the goodness-of-fit of
interpolations from isolated observations. Its main contribution is to
represent and manipulate simplicial complexes, topological structures
describing spaces built from cells.
