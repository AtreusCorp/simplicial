To do
=====

Simplicial complexes:

- Make allSimplices more optimised, selecting for the order of
  simplices up-front etc

- Allow deletion of a set of simplices in one operation

- File formats for complexes

- Re-structure internally to use only boundary operator matrices


Euler integration:

- Optimise the construction of level sets


Homology:

- Add a proper boundary operator


Derived complexes:

- Other ways to create sub-complexes as well as basis restriction
