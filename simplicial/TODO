To do
=====

Simplicial complexes:

- Make allSimplices more optimised, selecting for the order of
  simplices up-front etc

- Allow deletion of a set of simplices in one operation

- Other ways to create sub-complexes as well as basis restriction

- Add extra tests for intersection, to complement disjoint()

- Add  boundary operator


Euler integration:

- Optimise the construction of level sets
