Installation and dependencies
=============================

Dependencies
------------

``simplicial`` makes use of ``numpy`` for its main functionality. The
drawing routines (in the `simplicial.drawing` package) use
``matplotlib`` for their graphics backend: applications that aren't
going to do drawing can operate without ``matplotlib``.


Installation
------------

To install ``simplicial`` just use ``pip``:

::

    pip install simplicial
