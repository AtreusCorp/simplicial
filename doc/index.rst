simplicial: Simplicial topology in Python
=========================================

What is simplicial topology?
----------------------------


What is ``simplicial``?
-----------------------

``simplicial`` is a Python library for creating, manipulating, and exploring simplicial
complexes. It aims to provide a useful set of features for programmers and mathematicians
while remaining scalable to deal with large complexes.


Current features
----------------

* Compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.7 and later

* Represents finite closed simplicial complexes, with a lot of checking to ensure that
  that they stay legal as simplicies are added and removed (a common source of errors)

* Allows complexes to be embedded into spaces of arbitrary dimension to allow geometric
  as well as topological calculations to be performed
