Tutorial
========

Simplicial topology is quite an arcane subject, so if you've got this far in reading
about ``simplicial`` we'll assume you've got a good reason and understand at least
the basics of the maths involved. This tutorial will concentrate on using ``simplicial``
to create and manipulate simplicial complexes, and on what can be done to analyse them.
We will only present the basic operations, and ``simplicial`` provides a lot more: see
the :ref:`reference` for all the details.
